##  Stata Data Analysis Examples:Zero-inflated Poisson Regression



### translate from

**Version info**: Code for this page was tested in Stata 12.

Zero-inflated poisson regression is used to model count data that has an excess of zero counts.  
Further, theory suggests that the excess zeros
are generated by a separate process from the count values and that the excess zeros can be modeled independently.

Thus, the **zip** model has two parts, a poisson count model and the logit model
for predicting excess zeros. You may want to review these Data Analysis Example pages, [Poisson Regression](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/dae/poissonreg.htm) and[Logit Regression](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/dae/logit.htm).

**Please Note:** The purpose of this page is to show how to use various data analysis commands. 
It does not cover all aspects of the research process which researchers are expected to do. In 
particular, it does not cover data cleaning and verification, verification of assumptions, model 
diagnostics and potential follow-up analyses.

#### Examples of zero-inflated Poisson regression

Example 1.

School administrators study the attendance behavior of high school juniors over 
one semester at two schools.&nbsp; Attendance is measured by number of days of 
absent and is predicted by gender of the student and standardized
test scores in math and language arts.&nbsp; Many students have no absences 
during the semester.&nbsp;

Example 2.

The state wildlife biologists want to model how many fish are being caught by fishermen
at a state park.  Visitors are asked whether or not they have a camper, how many
people were in the group, were there children in the group and how many fish were caught.
Some visitors do not fish, but there is no data on whether a person fished or not.  Some
visitors who did fish did not catch any fish so there are excess zeros in the data because 
of the people that did not fish. 

<!-- 

Example 2. 

A study of the number of journal articles published by tenured faculty as a function of 
discipline (fine arts, science, social science, humanities, medical, 
etc).  To get tenure faculty must publish, i.e., there are  no tenured faculty with
zero publications.

Example 3.

A study by the county traffic court on the number of tickets received by teenagers 
as predicted by school performance, amount of driver training and gender.  Only individuals 
who have received at least one citation are in the traffic court files.

#### Description of the data

Let's pursue Example 2 from above.&nbsp; 

We have data on 250 groups that went to a park.&nbsp; Each group was questioned 
about how many fish they caught (**count**), how many children were in the 
group (**child**), how many people were in the group (**persons**), and 
whether or not they brought a camper to the park (**camper**).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

In addition to predicting the number of fish caught, there is interest in 
predicting the existence of excess zeros, i.e. the zeroes that were not simply a 
result of bad luck fishing. We will use the variables **child**, **persons**, and **camper** in our model. Let's look at the data.

#### Analysis methods you might consider

 Below is a list of some analysis methods you may have encountered.
Some of the methods listed are quite reasonable while others have either fallen out of favor or 
have limitations. 

*   Zero-inflated Poisson Regression - The focus of this web page.
*   Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression - Negative binomial regression does better with
	over dispersed data, i.e. variance much larger than the mean.*   Ordinary Count Models - Poisson or negative binomial models might be more
	appropriate if there are no excess zeros.
*   OLS Regression - You could try to analyze these data using OLS regression. However, count
	data are highly non-normal and are not well estimated by OLS regression.

#### Zero-inflated Poisson regression

We will run the **zip** command with **child** and **camper** as predictors of the counts,
**persons** as the predictor of the excess zeros.  We have included the **vuong** option
which provides a test of the zero-inflated model versus the standard poisson model.

The output looks very much like the output from an OLS regression:  

*   Begins with
the iteration log giving the values of the log likelihoods starting
with a model that has no predictors.  The last value in the log is the final value
of the log likelihood for the full model and is repeated below.
*   Next comes the header information. On the right-hand side the number ofobservations used (250), number of nonzero observations (108) are given along with the likelihoodratio chi-squared.&nbsp;This compares the full model to a model without count predictors, giving adifference of two degrees of freedom.&nbsp; This is followed by the p-value forthe chi-square. The model, as a whole, is statistically significant.*   Below the header you will find the Poisson regression coefficients for each of thecount predicting variables
along with standard errors, z-scores, p-values and 95% confidence intervals for the
coefficients.
*   Following these are logit coefficients for the variable predicting excess zeros along
with its standard errors, z-scores, p-values and confidence intervals.
*   Below the various coefficients you will find the results of the Vuong test.  The
Vuong test compares the zero-inflated model with an ordinary poisson regression model.
A significant z-test indicates that the zero-inflated model is better.

Now we can move on to the specifics of the individual results.

*   Using the **robust** option has resulted in a fairly large change in the model chi-square,
which is now a Wald chi-square.&nbsp; This statistic is based on log pseudo-likelihoods instead oflog-likelihoods.
*   The coefficients for **child** and **camper** can be interpreted as follows:
	
	*   For each unit increase of child the expected log count of the response variable decreases by 1.043.
    *   Being a camper increases the expected log count by .834.

* The inflate coefficient for **persons** suggests that for each unit increase in person the log odds of an inflated zero decrease by.564.

We can use the **margins** (introduced in Stata 11) to help understand our model.  We will
first compute the expected counts for the categorical variable **camper** while holding the
continuous variable **child** at its mean value using the **atmeans** option.

The expected count for the number of fish caught by noncampers is 1.289 while for campers it is
2.968 at the means of **child** and **persons**.

<p>Using the **dydx** option computes the difference in expected counts between **camper** 
= 0 and **camper** = 1 while still holding **child** at its mean of .684 
and **persons** at its mean of 2.528.

<p>The difference in the number of fish caught by campers and noncampers is 1.679, which is
statistically significant.

One last **margins** command will give the expected counts for values of **child** 
from zero to three at both levels of **camper**.

The expected number of fish caught goes down as the number of children goes up 
for both people with and without campers.

A number of model fit indicators are available using the **fitstat** command, which is
part of the **spostado** utilities by J. Scott Long and Jeremy Freese (**findit spostado**).

#### Things to consider

*   Since **zip** has both a count model and a logit
        model, each of the two models should have good predictors.  The two models do not        necessarily need to use the same predictors.
*   Problems of perfect prediction, separation or partial separation can occur in the
	logistic part of the zero-inflated model.
*   Count data often use exposure variables to indicate the number of times the event	could have happened. You can incorporate exposure into your model by using  the **exposure()**	option.
*   It is not recommended that zero-inflated poisson models be applied to	small samples.  What constitutes a small sample does not seem to be clearly defined
	in the literature.
*   Pseudo-R-squared values differ from OLS R-squareds, please see	[FAQ: What are	pseudo R-squareds?](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/faq/general/Psuedo_RSquareds.htm) for a discussion on this issue.
